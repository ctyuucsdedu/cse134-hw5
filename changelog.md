# Markup: I have changed the markup for my index.html nav bar from <ul> to a line of links, such that it would look more neat.

# Style: I have added borders and colors to the links to improve the visual of the site. I also added some hover effect to enhance the user experience.

# Content: I have added explainations to my hobbies such that users could be easier to understand the topics.

# 3rd party JavaScript: I have added Google Analytic to my site by copying the code from gtag.js into the head tag of index.html. After setting up the 3rd party javascript, I am now able to check how many user are visiting my website, new users, average engagement time, total revenue, and the activity of the users. By learning this infomations I could improve the site structure, style, and content as a developer in the future.
